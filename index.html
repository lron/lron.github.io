	<h5>Short Bio </h5>

		<p>I'm associate professor (lektor, in Danish) at <a href="https://www.kea.dk/">KEA - Copenhagen School of Design and Technology</a> (KEA Københavns Erhvervsakademi) since 2022, currently specialized in the areas of software security and cryptography.</p> 
		<p>Previously, I was assistant professor (adjunkt, in Danish) since 2016. From 2013 to 2015 I worked as a postdoc at the <a href="https://www.demtech.dk/">DemTech</a> project, led by <a href="https://www.itu.dk/people/carsten/">Carsten Schürmann</a>, at the <a href="https://www.itu.dk">IT University of Copenhagen</a> (ITU), in Denmark. My research there focused on cryptography applied to e-voting. I did my M.Sc. and also obtained my Ph.D at the <a href="https://www.uab.cat">Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona</a>, working on coding theory and data-hiding (steganography) under the supervision of professor <a href="https://deic.uab.cat/~jrifa">Josep Rifà i Coma</a>. During my Ph.D studies I was also a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://www.ucd.ie/">University College Dublin</a> in Ireland, under the supervision of professor <a href="https://people.ucd.ie/gary.mcguire">Gary McGuire</a>.</p>

		<p>Before that, and right after I finished my Computer Science Engineering degree at the <a href="https://www.uab.cat">Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona</a> (UAB), I worked as software developer first at <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales Group</a>, and then at the <a href="http://www.ancert.com">Spanish National Certification Notarial Agency</a>.</p>

		<!--<h5>Research interests </h5>

		<p>My past research career encompassed areas like cryptography (in particular, zero-knowledge proofs, commitment schemes), electronic voting (everlasting privacy, secret sharing, coercion-freeness), data-hiding (steganography), and coding theory (Z4-linear codes, nonlinear codes, perfect codes, syndrome coding problem). </p> -->

		<h5>External examiner </h5>
		<ul>
			I am part of the body of external examiners (censor, in Danish) in Computer Science in <a href="https://www.censorsekretariatet.dk/">businesses academies</a> (erhvervsakademier) and was also until 2022 part of the one for universities, for both individual courses and bachelor project exams.

	<div id="Interests" class="tab-content">

		<h5>Interests</h5>

		<p>
			My current interests are focused on <b>application security</b> (aka. appsec) and the broader field of DevSecOps, involving all the security activities and tests that can be incorporated in the different stages of the SDLC and in many cases also automated within the CI/CD pipeline. I have experience using threat modeling tools like <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/">OWASP Threat Dragon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing">SAST</a> tools like <a href="https://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_application_security_testing">DAST</a> tools like <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Burp Suite</a>, <a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/Software_Composition_Analysis">SCA</a> tools like <a href="https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/">Retire.js</a>, acceptance security testing tools like <a href="http://gauntlt.org/">Gauntlt</a>. among others. I am especially interested in software supply chain hardening including container security through best practices and vulnerability scanners like <a href="https://github.com/anchore/grype">Grype</a> or <a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy">Trivy</a>, as well as newer initiatives like the introduction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain">SBOM</a> through SBOM generator tools like <a href="https://github.com/anchore/syft">Syft</a>, and security frameworks like <a href="https://slsa.dev/">SLSA</a>. A lot is going on in the software supply chain security landscape and I find it promising and fascinating.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm also currently interested in the area of <b>cryptography</b> but from a more hands-on point of view, with a focus on the secure implementation of cryptographic primitives and security protocols. From the courses I've been teaching, I've gained experience using cryptographic libraries such as <a href="https://pynacl.readthedocs.io">PyNaCl</a>, which is a Python binding of <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium">libsodium</a> (which is in turn a fork of the well-known <a href="https://nacl.cr.yp.to/">NaCl</a> library), and the <a href="https://www.pycryptodome.org">PyCryptodome</a> library, which is an (improved with regards to secure defaults) fork of the old <a href="https://www.pycrypto.org/">PyCrypto</a>. From my past software development and consulting professional experiences I'm also familiar with the <a href="https://bouncycastle.org/">Bouncy Castle Crypto API</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have always enjoyed <b>teaching</b> and everything it involves: from designing the teaching materials and hands-on classroom activities, to connecting with the students, acknowledging their background and previous professional experiences and understanding their needs, challenges and learning styles, while creating a comfortable and engaging environment for them to acquire skills and competences relevant for the job market. A list of courses and other educational activities I've been involved in can be found under the Teaching tab.
		</p>
		<p>
			My past <b>research</b> career encompassed areas like cryptography (in particular, zero-knowledge proofs, commitment schemes), e-voting (everlasting privacy, secret sharing, coercion-freeness), data-hiding (steganography), and coding theory (Z4-linear codes, nonlinear codes, perfect codes, syndrome coding problem). A list of publications can be found under the Research tab.

		<h5>Consulting tasks</h5>
		
		<p>In 2014 I was part of the evaluation committee of the vVote electronic voting system, developed by the Victorian electoral commmission, Australia.</p> 
			
		<p>Our evaluation included a security audit of the software implementation, with both manual and automated source code reviews; a review of the implementation of cryptographic components (mix-net, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge, elliptic curve and threshold encryption, randomization); a remediation guidance of the issues identified; and a risk analysis.</p>
		
		Our report can no longer be accessed online but I can share it upon request.
